# 📝 TODO App (Simple)

A simple To-Do application that lets you manage tasks with basic functionality. It features a **visual login** screen, **task management**, and **localStorage persistence**—no database required!

## 🚀 Features

- **🔐 Visual Login**: Users are redirected to the main task page after logging in (no backend authentication).
- **➕ Add Tasks**: Easily add new tasks to your to-do list.
- **❌ Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks you no longer need.
- **✅ Mark as Done**: Mark tasks as completed when done.
- **💾 Persistence**: Tasks are saved in the browser's `localStorage`, so they persist even after refreshing the page.
